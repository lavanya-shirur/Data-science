The order which we gave got messed up very badly. We ordered Egg biryani and ended up getting chicken pieces(4-5). If you are a vegetarian don\'t go to this place they will serve you chicken rice for veg biryani and egg biryani. And another of my friend went there and ordered Egg biryaani bcoz he does not eat chicken but found 4-5 pieces of chicken in his biryani.

They've done well to learn the local language and treat you pleasantly.\nThe special tandoori variant of the day is to die for.

 'RATED\n  I feel it is a bit of hype and overpriced. Maybe I expected more. Went there with family and friends for a lunch buffet which was booked through Zomato app. They claim to be Goan. I expected Goan fare, but was kind of disappointed. I expected a Xacuti or a Vindaloo or a Balchao or a Sorpotel or a Cafreal or a Recheado. There was none. Probably that was the reason for disappointment. There was a Goan fish curry - but that is something so common and when it is made with Basa, makes it funny. Other food served was good. Crab was on the menu, but they were small ones. On starters, ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  The restaurant is based on Goa theme with various areas allocated in the name of different beaches of Goa..beautiful ambience with live music and the waiters are also dressed funkily in a beach theme..we went on a weekend which was also a festive occasion, gulabjamun & ice cream. Lovely place to chill with friends or spend some quality time with family. Must visit??'), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  One of the best food experiences I had in Bangalore.

Last time when ordered there was just crap piece of chicken in chicken biryani regular and 2 pcs of mutton in a regular mutton Biryani. I thought it would be just a mistake of one off staff so today went again and told them that last time it was not good exp. This time also when i ordered mutton biryani family pack. Was surprised to see only 4 small pieces of mutton in a family pack even after telling them last exp. Totally fool they are making.

So sad to see a good joint going bust.\n\n\nThis is a gem of a restaurant and their biryani is one of the best I have had..I have dined in as well as ordered online from this place and food is just amazing ...their service is also quite good ..do try their mutton biryani ..it cost around 190 and is enough for 2-3 people ...their chicken 65 and chicken tikka kabab are also very good ..and not to forget the chicken bharta ..due to this restaurant I know longer have to travel to Frazer town for pure mughlai food')," """"RATED\n  The place serves great food. Chicken curries are preped very well and their garlic naan settles expectations. We ordered fish malai tikka to start with which was yum. Ended up doubling our order and stuffing our throats.

I was hungry and I gulped the order as soon as it came which only meant it was both tasty and sufficient too. The base was soft and the chicken portions were good along with other toppings. The cheese could have been a bit more. The garlic roll didn\'t have enough in it to steal the show though. Overall a good experience", will definitely want to try their other variants of pizzas and pastas.'), 'RATED\n  Happened to visit Prestige Shantiniketan recently. Got a chance to grab a bite at Sbarro. I tried their 6 inch Cheese Pizza and Veg delight pizza. I liked what I ordered. Their base is really soft and taste is subtle.

We were a bit late, so by the time we reached, the starters and chat were empty. We had to wait for each one of these. The refilling was very slow.\nThere was not much variety, 2 veg and 2 non-veg starters excluding chats. Veg starters were very tasty. Main course was also good. In desserts, the manager was very good, when we told that we are not happy with the variety he got paneer Tikka and chicken biryani made for us.\nThey might not have a very prompt service but they will always help you out when you ask

Overall, ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  Had heard about a lot about Shanmukha . We went in a group of 5 and had an amazing experience . No matter the order took a little time to come as it was full with capacity but the taste and presentation of the items were great and very filling . Breads were soft and the curry was sufficient for 2 and even 3 if in a group.. The prices were fair and the service was good . Management can plan something in terms of some more pleasant music to make this outlet one of the best one .'), 'RATED\n  Superb place . Their Biriyani is simply great . If you have a flair to taste some great and different Biriyani, this should be on your list . I had tried and loved their Shanmukha Special Chicken Biriyani but for the first time we had Mutton Fry piece Biriyani and it is simply mind blowing . Taste you have never got before .. Great place for Biriyani lovers ....')," """"RATED\n  If it's biriyani you are after", this is the place.

I mean it's a little too much with very little to offer.\nYou have a really great place out here, ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  This is another great place to visit with frnds and family.

The first thing you will notice when u enter this place is the amazing number of board games they have. It took us around 15 mins just to find the right game to play. Coming to the food, the food was great but not the best I have eaten. The sizzler was served hot and fresh but did not taste that amazing. The cheese stick was cold and tasted okish. Overall not that great of an experience but if u have no other option this place is just fine. The ambience was also not that beautiful just decent. The service was great. Overall a pretty good experience and would not mind coming back.
